I wanted to flash Bluejay on some rebadged Flycolor/BLHeli_S ESCs that came with a Holybro S500 kit. The FC is running PX4 and doesn't do MSP nor 4-way passthrough. I tried reflashing a spare, disembodied FC with Ardupilot, but on power-up it freaked out because there were no connected sensors and I never got it to calm down long enough to flash the ESCs. I had some Raspberry Pi Picos (RP2040) lying around, so I figured I could mock enough of the MSP and 4-way interface to fool ESC Configurator into believing it was talking to an FC. The PIOs in particular are really good for the BLHeliBootloader protocol between the FC and the ESC over the PWM wire. It helped that I also had a SiLabs C2 dongle so I could solder to the pads on the ESC and debug it live. Anyway, I managed to get it all to work, and reflashed my ESCs one at a time by disconnecting them from the FC and plugging them into the Pico. I even customized the startup to play the opening bars from Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor, BWV 565. Right now the Pico code sits in a private repo on my personal github, but if there's interest I could open it up. It only works against the BLHeliBootloader on 8-bit ESCs, but I could see going farther with it.
